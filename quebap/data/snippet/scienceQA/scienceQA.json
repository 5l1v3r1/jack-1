          "text": "diabetes is a complex and complicated disease characterized by either lack of insulin or a resistance to insulin, a hormone which is crucial for metabolism of blood sugar. in a healthy person, the pancreas produces insulin to help metabolize sugar in the blood and maintain blood glucose (sugar) levels within their normal range. diabetics are unable to produce insulin or are resistant to insulin, and consequently cannot remove glucose from the bloodstream. whether there is inadequate insulin or insulin resistance, glucose levels in the blood increase and cause severe health problems. the classification of diabetes includes two main clinical classes: type 1 diabetes (previously called \u201cjuvenile diabetes\u201d) is an autoimmune disorder in which the insulin producing beta cells are destroyed by the body's immune system. as a result the body is unable to produce insulin, type 2 diabetes (previously called \u201cadult onset diabetes\u201d); in this type insulin is produced in insufficient amounts and/or cannot be used by the body to control blood sugar levels [1]. therefore the need to detect and treat diabetes becomes obvious to reduce its incidence and costly associated metabolic disease. for this reason, in recent times, many machine learning techniques have been considered to design automatic diagnosis system for diabetes. this paper specifically focuses on the use of fuzzy modeling method to detect medical problems which relies on discovering human comprehensible knowledge. fuzzy logic is originally proposed by zadeh [2], who aimed to improve a classification and decision support systems by using fuzzy sets to define the overlapping class definitions. the application of fuzzy \u201cif-then\u201d rules also improves the interpretability of the results and provides more insight cognition into the classifier structure and the decision making process [3]. the performance of fuzzy classifier system depends on the \u201cif-then\u201d rules and their numbers that are generated from numerical data or human experiences. more rules might enhance the classification result but increase the computation load. many intelligent methods, such as heuristic approaches [4], neural networks [5\u20137] and clustering method [8\u201310] have been proposed for building optimal fuzzy classifiers but in recent years evolutionary algorithms (eas) have been widely used to optimize fuzzy classifiers. in the literature several eas like genetic algorithm (ga), particle swarm optimization (pso) and ant colony optimization (aco) have been proposed to produce fuzzy classification system. ganji et al. [11] used aco algorithm to generate fuzzy classification rules called fsc-antminer. they have used artificial ants in order to explore the search space and gradually make candidate fuzzy rules. other works have adopted ga to optimize fuzzy classifiers [12\u201314]. in [15] sanie et al. used a hybrid genetic algorithm to produce fuzzy rules and boosted it with an ant colony optimization (aco) heuristic based on local search to improve the quality of their final classification system. in [16] the authors proposed a fuzzy modeling framework able to generate automatically a rule base through a two stage genetic based search. on the other hand, pso based approaches have proved their efficiency when optimizing fuzzy classification system. in [17] sousa et al. proposed a first application of pso as a new tool for classification rule discovery. holden and freitas [18] used a hybrid particle swarm optimization and ant colony optimization algorithm for discovering classification rules in data mining. rani and deepa [19] proposed a particle swarm optimization approach for optimal design of fuzzy classifier called psoflc. experiments are performed on iris dataset, where the proposed technique is compared to two well-known classification techniques, including genetic fuzzy classifier and gaussian fuzzy classifier. the framework used for designing the fuzzy model from the available input\u2013output data through pso algorithm was proposed in [20] and the detailed encoding method was also provided. khosla et al. [21] compared the computational efforts of pso and ga using the similar method in [20]. recently, a new artificial bee colony algorithm (abc) [22] was proposed as an alternative of the traditional evolutionary algorithms. the abc algorithm is very simple and flexible when compared to other swarm based algorithms such as particle swarm optimization. it does not require external parameters like mutation and crossover rates, which are hard to be defined in prior. the algorithm combines local search method with global one and tries to reach a certain balance between exploration and exploitation [22]. the abc algorithm has been successfully applied to a wide range of applications such as clustering analysis [23], neural network training [24], function optimization [25,26], wireless sensor network [36,37] and symbolic regression [38]."

(1992) and probabilistic gaussian mixtures (gm) have been pointed out recently by bezdek and pal (1995). we extend this relation to their training, showing that learning rules by these models to estimate the cluster centers can be seen as approximations to the expectation\u2013maximization (em) method as applied to gaussian mixtures. hcm and unsupervised, lvq use 1-of-c type competition. in fcm and flvq, membership is the \u22122/(m\u22121)th power of the distance. in scs and gm, gaussian function is used. if the gaussian membership function is used, the weighted within-groups sum of squared errors used as the fuzzy objective function corresponds to the maximum likelihood estimate in gaussian mixtures with equal priors and covariances. the fuzzy clustering method named fuzzy c-means alternating optimization procedure (fcm-ao) proposed to optimize the former is then equivalent to batch em and scs's update rule is a variant of the online version of em. the advantages of the probabilistic framework are: (i) we no longer have spurious spread parameters that needs fine tuning as m in fuzzy vector quantization or \u03b2 in scs; instead we have a variance term that has a sound interpretation and that can be estimated from the sample; (ii) em guarantees that the likelihood does not decrease, thus it converges to the nearest local optimum; (iii) em also allows us to estimate the underlying distance norm and the cluster priors which we could not with the other approaches. we compare gaussian mixtures trained with em with lvq (hcm), scs and flvq on the iris dataset and see that it is more accurate due to its being able to take into account the covariance information. we finally note that vector quantization is generally an intermediate step before finding a final output for which supervision may be possible. thus, instead of an uncoupled approach where an unsupervised method is used first to find the cluster parameters followed by supervised training of the mapping based on the memberships, we advocate a coupled approach where the cluster parameters and mapping are trained supervised in a coupled way. the uncoupled approach ignores the error at the outputs which may not be ideal."

(20) but still select the edge samples using eisdtp, then mies can obtain a kernel parameter value that yields a g-mean of 47.93%, larger than the original g-mean of 19.13% (see table 4); furthermore, if we use the new objective function and use esdcp to select the edge samples, namely, using the proposed imies, the g-mean further increases to 72.36 % (see table 4). this is an indication that eisdtp employed in the original mies has selected the improper edge or interior sample set. on the other hand, imies also outperforms dtl on five datasets (biomed, heart, ionosphere, breast and cardiotocography) and receives comparable g-means on the diabetes and the svmguide1 datasets. dtl gives unstable performance. for example, the performance of dtl can be comparable to that of imies on the diabetes and the svmguide1 datasets and even better on the spambase dataset. but for the heart and the ionosphere datasets, it results in overfitting models, with high tprs but low tnrs. the unstable performance is due to the fact that dtl gets a candidate kernel parameter by the bisection method in its iterations [27]; however, the bisection method could easily get stuck in a bad local optimum because of its sensitivity to the initial candidate interval of the kernel parameter. among these methods, only our method achieves high g-means on the test sets and gets good balances between tprs and tnrs. in summary, compared with other two methods, the proposed imies is able to select more suitable kernel parameters for ocsvm."

          "text": "we have demonstrated the use abductive machine learning for spam detection and the ranking of 57 spam detection attributes of the spambase dataset according to their predictive value. in general, the proposed approach offers the following advantages: improved classification accuracy, greater insight into the email feature set, data reduction through automatic exclusion of insignificant input features, simpler model development, and reduced training time. classification accuracies of about 91.7% were achieved with a single model that automatically selects only 10 input attributes, thus achieving data reduction by a ratio of approximately 6:1. accuracy was further improved up to 92.4% through the use of a 3-member abductive network ensembles with the members trained on different subsets of the training set using all 57 attributes. abductive modeling was compared with probabilistic neural networks employing a genetic learning algorithm and developed using the neuroshell classifier software. results indicate that the abductive approach gives better classification accuracy and requires much shorter training times. three methods were adopted for ranking the 57 attributes to determine the most effective spam predictors: (1) the z-statistic measure of the significance of the difference between the two means of each attribute for the spam and legitimate subsets of the data, (2) a gmdh-based approach of iteratively forcing the synthesis of a simple model and excluding the inputs selected at each stage, and (3) information provided by the neuroshell classifier on the relative importance of inputs to the genetic learning algorithm. the top most effective 12 predictors in each of the above three rankings have 9 attributes in common. the same 9 attributes are automatically selected by the 10-input optimum monolithic abductive network model. these attributes highlight the greater frequency of certain words or characters in either spam or legitimate messages. performance was compared with that of mlp neural networks and na\u00efve bayesian classifiers reported in the literature for the same email dataset. the comparison indicates that the abductive network models provide better classification accuracy, spam recall and spam precision with false-positive rates as low as 4.3%. future work would consider methods for finer ranking within attribute groups in the gmdh-based method to achieve complete ranking of the item set, and the use of ensembles with members trained using different learning paradigms to achieve further improvements in classification performance."

          "text": "to evaluate and compare the performance of the proposed approach, we used the spambase dataset [42]. this database has been created in june\u2013july 1999 by m. hopkins, e. reeber, g. forman, and j. suermondt at hewlett-packard labs. it consists of 4601 instances of legitimate and spam email messages with 39.4% being spam. each instance is characterized by 57 input attributes and is labeled as spam (represented as 1) or legitimate (represented as 0). table 2 lists the attribute number and name, as well as the average and standard deviation values for each attribute in both the legitimate and spam populations. attributes 1\u201348 give the percentage of words in the email message for the respective keyword indicated in the attribute name. attributes 49\u201354 give the percentage of characters in the email message for the respective character indicated in the attribute name. attributes 55 and 56 give the average and maximum lengths, respectively, of uninterrupted sequences of capital letters in the message. attribute 57 gives the total number of capital letters in the message. the attribute number will be used as the variable number for models described throughout this paper. attribute number 58 in the dataset is the true email class. the dataset has no missing attribute values. table 2 also lists the mean and standard deviation of each attribute in both the legitimate population (\u03bcl and \u03c3l respectively) and spam population (\u03bcs and \u03c3s respectively). the last column in table 2 gives the absolute value of the z statistic for each attribute. the z parameter measures the magnitude of the absolute difference between the two means of a given attribute in the legitimate and spam populations relative to variations about the two means. the larger the value of z, the more significant is the difference between the two means and therefore the larger the value discriminatory power of the attribute in classifying the dataset as spam/legitimate. sorting the list of input attributes in a descending order based on the values of their z statistic gives the following ranking: {21, 25, 26, 19, 23, 7, 53, 52, 16, 5, 27, 17, 57, 6, 11, 9, 30, 37, 3, 24, 18, 35, 28, 8, 46, 56, 45, 42, 43, 29, 15, 36, 31, 20, 39, 33, 32, 10, 34, 1, 13, 41, 44, 48, 55, 50, 22, 40, 51, 49, 14, 54, 47, 4, 38, 2, 12}. attributes toward the beginning of the list should prove more effective than attributes toward the end. however, this simple ranking approach does not take into account possible mutual correlation between various attributes when grouped together to classify the dataset. since using several attributes is more common in discriminating spam from legitimate emails and leads to better results, forming subsets of attributes based on the ranking of individual attributes may not produce compact subsets of predictors and may miss complementary attributes that have low individual ranking."

          "text": "abductive network models were developed for classifying the spambase dataset into spam or legitimate messages. the dataset was randomly split into a training set of 2844 cases and an evaluation set of 1757 cases. the percentage of spam in the two datasets was 38.4% and 41.1%, respectively. in the first modeling experiment, the full training set was used to develop abductive network models that utilize all available 57 attributes for spam classification. we refer to such models as monolithic models to contrast them with those developed later using the modular approach of abductive network ensembles to be described in section 5.2. table 3 shows the abductive model structures synthesized at three levels of model complexity as indicated by the cpm parameter specified prior to training, together with their classification accuracy on both the training and evaluation sets. the variable number indicated at a model input, e.g. var_i, corresponds to the number of the attribute selected as input to the model during training. var_58 is the binary classification model output (i.e. spam or legitimate). as the cpm value increased, simpler models are synthesized. in all three models developed with cpm=0.3, 1, and 3; only a small subset of the 57 input attributes is selected automatically during training. the number of selected attributes is 10, 10, and 9, respectively. eight attributes {7, 16, 21, 23, 25, 46, 52, and 53} are common to all three input subsets. this indicates the effectiveness of such attributes as spam predictors and the robustness of the modeling process. during model evaluation on the evaluation set, computed model output was rounded to 0 (legitimate) or 1 (spam) based on a simple threshold of 0.5. we will later consider operation at other thresholds by presenting the receiver operator characteristics in section 5.4. classification performance on the external evaluation set is approximately equal to that on the training set. best classification performance on the evaluation set is obtained using the optimum model with cpm=1 which gives a classification accuracy of 91.7%. this model will be considered as the optimum monolithic model throughout the paper. the subset of 10 input attributes selected by this model is {5, 7, 16, 21, 23, 25, 27, 46, 52, and 53}. eight of these 10 attributes are among the top 10 positions of the z statistic ranking given in section 4, which confirms their superior explanatory qualities. table 4(a) shows the resulting confusion matrix and table 5(a) lists the parameters characterizing the classification performance of this optimum model on the evaluation set, in terms of sensitivity, specificity, \u201cspam\u201d precision, and \u201clegitimate\u201d precision, as well as classification accuracy. the results indicate a minimum value of approximately 88.2% for all performance parameters. a good aspect of this classifier is that specificity is greater than sensitivity. this means fewer false-positive (fp) classification errors where a legitimate email is wrongly classified as spam email, which is a more serious outcome compared to a spam being considered as legitimate i.e. a false negative (fn). table 4(a) gives the number of fp and fn errors as 61 and 85, respectively, out of the 1757 evaluation cases."

          "text": "the effectiveness of using multilayer perceptron neural networks and na\u00efve bayesian classifiers has been recently evaluated for spam filtering on the spambase dataset used in this paper [48]. in [48], the dataset was randomly shuffled and then partitioned into five independent subsets using 5-fold cross validation. five experiments were conducted. in each experiment, four subsets were used for training the classifier and the remaining subset was used for evaluation. the authors of [48] examined various mlp architectures to determine the best classifier model which was then tested for various cutoff threshold values (see table 6 in [48]). they also tested the na\u00efve bayesian classifier (see table 7 in [48]). our comparisons with their best models are based on classification accuracy (acc), false-positive rate (fpr), false-negative rate (fnr), spam recall (sr), spam precision (sp) and f-measure (fm). table 9 summarizes the performance of our four abductive modeling experiments of table 5 of this paper, and that of the five mlp experiments and five nb experiments reported in [48]. in contrast to their work, we label \u201cspam\u201d as positive and \u201clegitimate\u201d as negative, which is more common in anti-spam literature, and we recalculated the performance measures for their work according to the definitions in section 3. the results indicate that our proposed approaches yield much better performance compared to the na\u00efve bayesian classifier in all cases and offer a slight improvement on the mlp models in most of the cases in terms of classification accuracy, spam recall and spam precision. moreover, unlike the mlp that requires long training times (see section 7 in [48]), the gmdh-based approach requires much shorter training time as shown in table 8."

          "text": "additionally, the execution time of the proposed method has been also compared to those of the wrapper-based feature selection methods on the different datasets and the obtained results are reported in table 13. the reported results show that in most cases the execution time of the proposed method is lower than the wrapper based methods. for example it can be seen from the results that the gcaco selected the final subset of features for spambase dataset after 6846ms. while in this case the hgafs, acofs and hgafs selected the final subset after 98,328, 87,193 and 531,439ms respectively. in this case the results show the proposed method is nearly 88 times faster than the psofs method. while the results of table 10 show that the accuracy of psofs method is only 0.5 times higher than gcaco method. moreover, the results show that for very large datasets such as arcene the execution time of the hgafs and acofs methods are lower than the proposed method. this is due to the fact that these methods are executed in two steps. in the first step they applied a filter based method (such as information gain or gini-index) to rank the features independently and then a small size subset (i.e. a subset with only 100 top ranked features) are selected to be incorporated a wrapper based method in the second step. while in this case the proposed method is applied over all of the original features. on the other hand table 10 results show that in this case the classification accuracy of the proposed method is much higher than the hgafs and acofs methods."

          "text": "one of the most popular image representations for image classification is based on the bag-of-words (bow) features. however, the number of keypoints that need to be detected from images to generate the bow features is usually very large, which causes two problems. first, the computational cost during the vector quantization step is high. second, some of the detected keypoints are not helpful for recognition. to resolve these limitations, we introduce a framework, called iterative keypoint selection (iks), with which to select representative keypoints for accelerating the computational time to generate the bow features, leading to more discriminative feature representation. each iteration in iks is comprised of two steps. in the first step some representative keypoint(s) are identified from each image. then, the keypoints are filtered out if the distances between them and the identified representative keypoint(s) are less than a pre-defined distance. the iteration process continues until no unrepresentative keypoints can be found. two specific approaches are proposed to perform the first step of iks. iks1 focuses on randomly selecting one representative keypoint and iks2 is based on a clustering algorithm in which the representative keypoints are the closest points to their cluster centers. experiments carried out based on the caltech 101, caltech 256, and pascal 2007 datasets demonstrate that performing keypoint selection using iks1 and iks2 to generate both the bow and spatial-based bow features allows the support vector machine (svm) classifier to provide better classification accuracy than with the baseline features without keypoint selection. however, it is found that the computational cost of iks1 is larger than the baseline methods. on the other hand, iks2 is able to not only efficiently generate the bow and spatial-based features that reduce the computational time for vector quantization over these datasets, but also provides better classification results than iks1 over the pascal 2007 and caltech 256 datasets."
